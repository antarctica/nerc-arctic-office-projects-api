                          abstract: The Arctic climate is changing twice as fast as the global average and these dramatic changes are evident in the decreases in sea ice extent over the last few decades. The lowest sea ice cover to date was recorded in 2007 and recent data suggests sea ice cover this year may be even lower. Clouds play a major role in the Arctic climate and therefore influence the extent of sea ice, but our understanding of these clouds is very poor. Low level, visually thick, clouds in much of the world tend to have a cooling effect, because they reflect sunlight back into space that would otherwise be absorbed at the surface. However, in the Arctic this albedo effect is not as important because the surface, often being covered in snow and ice, is already highly reflective and Arctic clouds therefore tend to warm instead of cooling. Warming in the Arctic can, in turn, lead to sea ice break-up which exposes dark underlying sea water. The sea water absorbs more of the sun's energy, thus amplifying the original warming. Hence, small changes in cloud properties or coverage can lead to dramatic changes in the Arctic climate; this is where the proposed research project comes in.

                        title: Aerosol-Cloud Coupling And Climate Interactions in the Arctic
                        abstract: The Arctic climate is changing twice as fast as the global average and these dramatic changes are evident in the decreases in sea ice extent over the last few decades. The lowest sea ice cover to date was recorded in 2007 and recent data suggests sea ice cover this year may be even lower. Clouds play a major role in the Arctic climate and therefore influence the extent of sea ice, but our understanding of these clouds is very poor. Low level, visually thick, clouds in much of the world tend to have a cooling effect, because they reflect sunlight back into space that would otherwise be absorbed at the surface. However, in the Arctic this albedo effect is not as important because the surface, often being covered in snow and ice, is already highly reflective and Arctic clouds therefore tend to warm instead of cooling. Warming in the Arctic can, in turn, lead to sea ice break-up which exposes dark underlying sea water. The sea water absorbs more of the sun's energy, thus amplifying the original warming. Hence, small changes in cloud properties or coverage can lead to dramatic changes in the Arctic climate; this is where the proposed research project comes in.

                        title: Aerosol-Cloud Coupling And Climate Interactions in the Arctic
                        abstract: The Arctic climate is changing twice as fast as the global average and these dramatic changes are evident in the decreases in sea ice extent over the last few decades. The lowest sea ice cover to date was recorded in 2007 and recent data suggests sea ice cover this year may be even lower. Clouds play a major role in the Arctic climate and therefore influence the extent of sea ice, but our understanding of these clouds is very poor. Low level, visually thick, clouds in much of the world tend to have a cooling effect, because they reflect sunlight back into space that would otherwise be absorbed at the surface. However, in the Arctic this albedo effect is not as important because the surface, often being covered in snow and ice, is already highly reflective and Arctic clouds therefore tend to warm instead of cooling. Warming in the Arctic can, in turn, lead to sea ice break-up which exposes dark underlying sea water. The sea water absorbs more of the sun's energy, thus amplifying the original warming. Hence, small changes in cloud properties or coverage can lead to dramatic changes in the Arctic climate; this is where the proposed research project comes in.

                          title: Aerosol-Cloud Coupling And Climate Interactions in the Arctic
                          abstract: The Arctic climate is changing twice as fast as the global average and these dramatic changes are evident in the decreases in sea ice extent over the last few decades. The lowest sea ice cover to date was recorded in 2007 and recent data suggests sea ice cover this year may be even lower. Clouds play a major role in the Arctic climate and therefore influence the extent of sea ice, but our understanding of these clouds is very poor. Low level, visually thick, clouds in much of the world tend to have a cooling effect, because they reflect sunlight back into space that would otherwise be absorbed at the surface. However, in the Arctic this albedo effect is not as important because the surface, often being covered in snow and ice, is already highly reflective and Arctic clouds therefore tend to warm instead of cooling. Warming in the Arctic can, in turn, lead to sea ice break-up which exposes dark underlying sea water. The sea water absorbs more of the sun's energy, thus amplifying the original warming. Hence, small changes in cloud properties or coverage can lead to dramatic changes in the Arctic climate; this is where the proposed research project comes in.

                        title: Aerosol-Cloud Coupling And Climate Interactions in the Arctic
                        abstract: The Arctic climate is changing twice as fast as the global average and these dramatic changes are evident in the decreases in sea ice extent over the last few decades. The lowest sea ice cover to date was recorded in 2007 and recent data suggests sea ice cover this year may be even lower. Clouds play a major role in the Arctic climate and therefore influence the extent of sea ice, but our understanding of these clouds is very poor. Low level, visually thick, clouds in much of the world tend to have a cooling effect, because they reflect sunlight back into space that would otherwise be absorbed at the surface. However, in the Arctic this albedo effect is not as important because the surface, often being covered in snow and ice, is already highly reflective and Arctic clouds therefore tend to warm instead of cooling. Warming in the Arctic can, in turn, lead to sea ice break-up which exposes dark underlying sea water. The sea water absorbs more of the sun's energy, thus amplifying the original warming. Hence, small changes in cloud properties or coverage can lead to dramatic changes in the Arctic climate; this is where the proposed research project comes in.

                        title: Aerosol-Cloud Coupling And Climate Interactions in the Arctic
                        abstract: The Arctic climate is changing twice as fast as the global average and these dramatic changes are evident in the decreases in sea ice extent over the last few decades. The lowest sea ice cover to date was recorded in 2007 and recent data suggests sea ice cover this year may be even lower. Clouds play a major role in the Arctic climate and therefore influence the extent of sea ice, but our understanding of these clouds is very poor. Low level, visually thick, clouds in much of the world tend to have a cooling effect, because they reflect sunlight back into space that would otherwise be absorbed at the surface. However, in the Arctic this albedo effect is not as important because the surface, often being covered in snow and ice, is already highly reflective and Arctic clouds therefore tend to warm instead of cooling. Warming in the Arctic can, in turn, lead to sea ice break-up which exposes dark underlying sea water. The sea water absorbs more of the sun's energy, thus amplifying the original warming. Hence, small changes in cloud properties or coverage can lead to dramatic changes in the Arctic climate; this is where the proposed research project comes in.

                        title: Aerosol-Cloud Coupling And Climate Interactions in the Arctic
                        abstract: The Arctic climate is changing twice as fast as the global average and these dramatic changes are evident in the decreases in sea ice extent over the last few decades. The lowest sea ice cover to date was recorded in 2007 and recent data suggests sea ice cover this year may be even lower. Clouds play a major role in the Arctic climate and therefore influence the extent of sea ice, but our understanding of these clouds is very poor. Low level, visually thick, clouds in much of the world tend to have a cooling effect, because they reflect sunlight back into space that would otherwise be absorbed at the surface. However, in the Arctic this albedo effect is not as important because the surface, often being covered in snow and ice, is already highly reflective and Arctic clouds therefore tend to warm instead of cooling. Warming in the Arctic can, in turn, lead to sea ice break-up which exposes dark underlying sea water. The sea water absorbs more of the sun's energy, thus amplifying the original warming. Hence, small changes in cloud properties or coverage can lead to dramatic changes in the Arctic climate; this is where the proposed research project comes in.

                          title: Aerosol-Cloud Coupling And Climate Interactions in the Arctic
                          abstract: The Arctic climate is changing twice as fast as the global average and these dramatic changes are evident in the decreases in sea ice extent over the last few decades. The lowest sea ice cover to date was recorded in 2007 and recent data suggests sea ice cover this year may be even lower. Clouds play a major role in the Arctic climate and therefore influence the extent of sea ice, but our understanding of these clouds is very poor. Low level, visually thick, clouds in much of the world tend to have a cooling effect, because they reflect sunlight back into space that would otherwise be absorbed at the surface. However, in the Arctic this albedo effect is not as important because the surface, often being covered in snow and ice, is already highly reflective and Arctic clouds therefore tend to warm instead of cooling. Warming in the Arctic can, in turn, lead to sea ice break-up which exposes dark underlying sea water. The sea water absorbs more of the sun's energy, thus amplifying the original warming. Hence, small changes in cloud properties or coverage can lead to dramatic changes in the Arctic climate; this is where the proposed research project comes in.
